# Effects of weather in yellow fever epidemiology

## Project Description

This project investigates the potential correlation between temperature, precipitation, and sudden increases in yellow fever cases in Brazil between 2010 and 2019. We used epidemiological and meteorological data to analyze this relationship, focusing on three specific states: Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais.

## Data Used

1. **Epidemiological Data**: A CSV file containing information on yellow fever cases by state in Brazil.
2. **Meteorological Data**: Data obtained from an API, containing detailed daily information on temperature and precipitation from 2010 to 2019.

### Analyzed States
- **Rio de Janeiro**
- **São Paulo**
- **Minas Gerais**

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Epidemiological data were collected and organized into a CSV dataframe.
   - Meteorological data were extracted from an API, containing daily records of temperature and precipitation.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - The data were cleaned and prepared for analysis.
   - We performed correlations between the meteorological data and yellow fever outbreaks in the selected states.
   - Statistical techniques were used to determine the significance of the observed correlations.
